# ðŸ›¸ Alien Invasion using pygame ðŸ‘¾

Following the guidelines to make Alien Invasion with pygame through **"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes**

![Alien Invasion Start Screen](/startscreen.png)

UI Changes:

- Changed background color
- Changed Font
- Changed ship and alien images, created by me using https://www.piskelapp.com/

## Description ðŸš€

To move the ship right or left, use the corresponding arrow keys or `A` and `D` and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears at the top and moves across and down the screen. After each fleet is destroyed, a new fleet appears that will be faster than the previous one. Once an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, or hits the player's ship with a bullet, then the player loses a ship. Once the player loses all his ships, the game is over.

## Cloning the game for yourself ðŸŽ®

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bryanlds/Alien-Invasion.git

$ cd Alien-Invasion
```

install necessary packages with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run:

```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```

Have Fun!
